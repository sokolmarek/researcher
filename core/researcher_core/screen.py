"""Dual independent screening, blinded adjudication, kappa, and a ranked queue (M4.4, M4.5).

Screening is two streams keyed by ``screener_id``. Each stream is a sequence of
``screening_decision`` events (D19), one per record per stage, carrying the record id, the
stage (``title-abstract`` or ``full-text``), the decision (``include`` / ``exclude``), and
a reason drawn from the locked eligibility profile. Nothing here reads the clock: every
``ts`` is caller-supplied, so a replay of the same events reproduces the same ledger byte
for byte (D15).

Four properties are load-bearing and are enforced here rather than left to callers:

1. **Blinded adjudication.** :func:`screen_conflicts` surfaces the records the two streams
   disagree on, and the object it hands the adjudicator carries the record and the
   eligibility profile ONLY. It never carries either screener's verdict or reason. A
   :class:`Conflict` has no field in which a vote could hide, and
   :meth:`Conflict.adjudication_prompt` returns exactly ``{record_id, stage, record,
   eligibility_profile}``. The link back to the two original decisions travels as a pair of
   opaque content-addressed event ids, which reveal nothing about which way either screener
   voted.

2. **Adjudication is recorded, not inferred.** :func:`record_adjudication` emits an
   ``adjudication`` event carrying the resolved verdict, the rationale, and BOTH original
   ``screening_decision`` event ids, so the ledger proves which two decisions a resolution
   reconciled.

3. **Cohen's kappa is derived, never stored** (D10). :func:`cohens_kappa` aggregates the
   two streams from the ledger and computes ``(po - pe) / (1 - pe)`` over the records both
   screeners decided. Single-screener runs are reported as such (:attr:`KappaResult.
   single_screener`) rather than hidden, so the report can disclose the limitation.

4. **Prioritization changes ORDER only.** :func:`rank_queue` reorders the remaining queue by
   lexical similarity to the already-included records. Every record is still returned, no
   record is dropped, and no record is auto-excluded; disabling the flag restores insertion
   order exactly.

Decisions are strings, never booleans (D9): ``include`` and ``exclude`` are the two the
eligibility workflow uses, but the kappa and conflict machinery treats the category set as
open, so a stream that records a third category is handled rather than silently coerced.
