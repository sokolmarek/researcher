"""Living-review monitoring: saved searches and diff-on-rerun (M4.11).

A living review is a systematic review that is re-run on a schedule instead of redone
from scratch. This module holds the piece that makes "re-run" mean "only the new records":
a saved monitoring state (the verbatim per-database strategies, the last-run timestamp, and
the list of record ids already seen) plus a diff that, on each rerun, reports ONLY the
records that were not seen before.

Three properties are load-bearing, so they live here rather than in the discipline of
callers:

1. **The diff is auditable offline.** :func:`run_monitor` executes strategies through a
   caller-supplied ``executor``. In production the CLI passes a search-layer executor that
   replays from snapshots (D15); tests pass a plain function returning canned ids. Either
   way the diff runs over recorded results, never a live call made from inside this module.

2. **``ts`` is caller-supplied, never read from the clock** (D19, D15). Nothing here calls
   ``time.time()`` or ``datetime.now()``: a self-generated timestamp would make two replays
   of the same rerun differ. The last-run timestamp is validated with the same
   :func:`researcher_core.provenance.normalize_ts` the ledger uses, and returned verbatim.

3. **The seen-id list only grows.** :class:`MonitorState` is immutable; :func:`update_state`
   returns a NEW state with the unseen ids appended (order-stable, deduplicated) and the
   last-run timestamp advanced. There is no path that shrinks or reorders the seen list, so
   a record reported as new in one rerun is never reported as new again.

The new batch a rerun returns is exactly what the M4.4 screening streams consume next: the
same locked protocol, a new set of records to screen. This module produces the batch and,
optionally, the ``retrieval`` provenance events that record it (:func:`retrieval_events`);
writing them to the ledger is the caller's job.
