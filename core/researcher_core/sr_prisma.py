"""PRISMA 2020 reporting layer, derived entirely from the provenance ledger (D10).

PRISMA 2020 is a REPORTING view, never the architecture. The architecture is the
append-only event ledger in :mod:`researcher_core.provenance`; the flow diagram and the
checklist are aggregations OVER it. No count in this module is ever stored: every number
falls out of the events each time it is asked for, so a count can never drift away from
the evidence it claims to summarize (D10). Delete a screening event and the derived flow
changes, which is the property the tests pin down.

Where :meth:`ProvenanceLedger.prisma` gives the basic identified / deduplicated / screened
/ included counts, this module extends them into the full PRISMA 2020 shape:

* per-database identified counts (from ``retrieval`` payloads);
* duplicates removed (from ``dedup_decision`` payloads);
* records screened and records excluded at the title/abstract stage;
* reports sought, reports retrieved / assessed, and reports EXCLUDED WITH REASONS at the
  full-text stage (from ``screening_decision`` payloads, resolved through ``adjudication``
  events for dual-screened records);
* studies included.

It also derives a PRISMA 2020 checklist coverage report: each relevant checklist item is
mapped to the ledger evidence that satisfies it (item 7 search strategy from the verbatim
retrieval queries, item 16a flow from the derived flow, and so on), or marked
author-supplied when no event can stand in for the author's prose.

Nothing here reads the clock. It only reads events, so replays are byte-identical (D15).

Payload conventions this module relies on (the ledger payload is open by schema, so these
are conventions rather than schema constraints, and both the M4 vocabulary and the older
``derive_prisma`` vocabulary are accepted):

* ``screening_decision``:
  ``{"record_id", "stage", "verdict"|"decision", "reason", "screener_id"}``.
  ``stage`` is normalized (title/abstract vs full-text); a missing stage is treated as
  title/abstract. ``verdict`` (or ``decision``) is normalized to ``include`` / ``exclude``;
  any other value (``maybe``, ``unclear``) is a pending record, never an exclusion.
* ``adjudication``:
  ``{"record_id", "stage", "verdict"|"resolved_verdict", "reason", "resolves": [...]}``.
  An adjudication is the resolved decision for a dual-screened record and OVERRIDES the two
  streams for that ``(record_id, stage)``.
* ``protocol_locked`` / ``amendment``: presence is the evidence for the registration and
  protocol checklist items; the payload is not otherwise interpreted here.
