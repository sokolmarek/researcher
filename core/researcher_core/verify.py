"""Axis (a): reference identity (D9, D16).

Does the reference a manuscript cites actually exist, and is it the work the entry claims
it is? Nothing else. Whether that work was later retracted is axis (b) (``status.py``);
whether it supports the sentence citing it is axis (c) (``faithfulness.py``). The axes are
independent and are reported side by side, never folded into one verdict.

Two vocabularies, and they must never be conflated.

**Per-source outcome** (what one index said):

* ``confirmed``    the source resolved the reference and the metadata matched within thresholds
* ``negative``     the query succeeded and produced no match within thresholds (a clean negative)
* ``source_error`` timeout, rate limit, 5xx, network failure: no clean answer was obtained

A ``negative`` splits further, and the split is load-bearing. ``resolved=False`` means the
source cleanly found nothing. ``resolved=True`` with ``mismatch_reasons`` means the source
DID resolve the identifier but the metadata disagrees beyond thresholds: that is evidence
for ``mismatch``, not for ``unresolvable``.

**Reference-level verdict** (what the report says), exactly four states:

* ``verified``      >= 2 sources confirmed
* ``mismatch``      a resolving source disagrees beyond thresholds (wrong DOI, mangled entry)
* ``unresolvable``  ALL queried sources returned a clean negative and none confirmed
* ``inconclusive``  evidence too thin or too dirty to decide

ONLY ``unresolvable`` and ``mismatch`` are refusal-grade. ``inconclusive`` is NEVER
refusal-grade. See :func:`decide`, where the precedence is implemented, for why that line is
the most important one in this file.

Thresholds are calibrated against ``core/tests/snapshots/verify-gold/`` and recorded in
``core/CALIBRATION.md``. The values in :data:`DEFAULT_THRESHOLDS` are the ones that file
documents; the report carries them so a verdict can never be read without the rule that
produced it.

    The remaining three are the calibrated refinements the gold subset forced, each of which

    title and author. None of them can turn a non-matching record into a confirmation.

    * ``strong_title_similarity``: the bar a title must clear before any relaxation applies.
    * ``preprint_year_tolerance``: a preprint and its journal version are the same work with
      two DOIs and two years, often three years apart. Citing the published year against the
      preprint DOI is correct scholarship, and under a flat +/-1 year rule two indexes would
      both "disagree" and produce a refusal-grade ``mismatch`` on a real, honest reference.
      That is the worst failure this system can have, so the year window widens (only) when
